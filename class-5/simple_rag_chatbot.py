        ## What is Artificial Intelligence?
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
        intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI systems can perform 
        tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, 
        speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
        
        ## Machine Learning Basics
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and 
        improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three 
        main types of machine learning:
        
        1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
        2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labels
        3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error
        
        ## Deep Learning
        Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with 
        multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. 
        It's particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language 
        processing, and speech recognition.
        
        ## Natural Language Processing
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the 
        interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to 
        understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.
        
        ## Applications of AI
        - Healthcare: Medical diagnosis and drug discovery
        - Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
        - Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
        - Entertainment: Recommendation systems
        - Education: Personalized learning platforms
        
        ## The Future of AI
        AI continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in areas like 
        generative AI, robotics, and quantum computing. As AI becomes more 
        sophisticated, it will likely transform many aspects of our daily lives 
        and work.
