      "List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They are a syntactic sugar that allows you to generate lists in a single line of code, making them more readable and often more efficient than traditional `for` loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "A basic structure of a list comprehension looks like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **expression**: This is the value to be added to the new list.\n",
      "- **item**: The variable that takes the value of the elements in the iterable.\n",
      "- **iterable**: Any Python iterable (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
      "- **condition**: (Optional) A filter that only includes items that satisfy a certain condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Simple Example\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say we want to create a list of squares for the numbers from 0 to 9. We can use a list comprehension to do this succinctly:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "print(squares)\n",
      "```\n",

      "### Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `x**2` is the expression that computes the square of `x`.\n",
      "2. `for x in range(10)` iterates over the numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
      "3. There is no condition in this case, so all values are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you run the above code, you will get:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
